# Changelog

## 0.1.0

First release. Enough to replace one repository's `make`, and no more.

- `xtask.yaml` parsing with `--validate`, and errors that name the line rather
  than the file.
- The graph: `needs`, `then`, cycle detection with the cycle spelled out,
  run-once per invocation, declared order, and the five exit codes — `4`
  included, for a body that succeeded and a continuation that did not.
- Bodies: `run` as argv, `do` naming a verb the project registered, `args`,
  `argv-from`, `each`, `in`, `env`. Executable resolution honours `PATH`,
  `PATHEXT` and the fact that Windows cannot start a batch shim directly.
- `env-required`, checked before a body runs. The engine installs nothing.
- Sets: lists and globs with exclusions, expanded by the engine in a
  deterministic order. An expansion matching nothing is an error.
- Gate sets, the `collects:` derivation, `--list` and `--gate-members`, and
  log-grouping markers on a host that folds output.
- The `remove` primitive, which is the whole built-in list.
- `--dry-run`, printing what a run resolves to rather than what is written.
- `--emit-schema`, a JSON Schema for editors, generated from the same key lists
  the parser refuses unknown keys with.

Deliberately not here: `--emit-ci`, `--dry-run` output formats, a watch mode,
task timing, coloured output, shell completion. Each is a real convenience and
each is a place to hide a second list.
